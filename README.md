Steps to get a basic website with tableau viz working : 

1. Download bootstrap (choose the Source code option) - http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#download
2. After you unzip the downloaded zip, go to docs/examples/navbar-fixed-top
3. Get the HousingActivity.html from this repo.
4. Open this new html in the browser.
5. You should see a bare bones viz. 
6. Generate the embedded code for your tableau viz - for this a) Upload your viz to tableau public and b) Click on share - you will see an option to get embedded html code.
7. To get your own viz into this html, add the embedded code for your tableau viz after the section <!-- NOTE - EMBED YOUR INVESTMENT VIZ FROM TABLEAU PUBLIC HERE --> in the html
8. Open the html again and you should see your viz.

What next?
1. We can pick other templates of bootstrap, improve upon the viz, choose different fonts, etc, etc. This is just one place to access all the viz.
2. Please push your local html files appended with your name - like Housing_RAGHU.html, etc. That way, we will not overwrite each others changes and at the same time, 
we will know how to see the viz produced by the team.
3. We should push the js, css, icons, etc. required for the website too later, once we finalize them. To finalize them, we should choose the correct template, some images, text, icons, etc. We can do this through this week (week of Nov 21-28).
